The Tuck team is starting outreach for buy side client ABC next week. They want to give potential buyers access to an AI-generated analysis of synergies between the buyer’s business and ABC.

Your job is to write a function (or a set of functions) that parses the analysis from our custom GPT and allows clients to access / add to it via an API. You can implement this in any way you see fit, as long as you use either Python or JS/TS as your primary language. 

Instructions
Follow the link to this custom GPT. Click the “Analyze Potential ABC buyer” button on the GPT to generate the JSON file you’ll use as input.
Write your function(s) to parse the markdown from the “gptOutput” field.
Write a locally hosted API with the following endpoints:
GET: no parameters in the request body, returns the current markdown string.
POST: takes a string as a parameter in the request body, and “updates” the existing markdown (ie. adds the string to the end of the existing markdown as a new sentence). The next time a GET / POST request to the API is made, it uses the updated markdown string. Note: For the sake of this exercise, think about implementing a more persistent storage method than local memory.
Add a short README describing how to run and test your API locally.

this is how the json looks like:

{
  "company": "Preppy LLC",
  "buyer": "Google Classroom",
  "matrix_cell": "3,4",
  "gptOutput": "Attached is the output generated regarding your company, Preppy LLC, and Google Classroom.\n\nThe analysis considers a hypothetical acquisition of Preppy LLC by Google Classroom. Both companies operate in the education sector, with Preppy focusing on career certifications and job-readiness through its online platform, and Google Classroom as a comprehensive educational management tool serving a wide spectrum of academic and professional learners.\n\n### Strategic Benefits of Acquiring Preppy LLC\nThe strategic acquisition of Preppy LLC by Google Classroom could yield the following benefits:\n\n1. **Expansion of Career Certification Offerings**: Preppy’s extensive certification programs across trades, healthcare, and technology can complement Google Classroom’s focus on educational tools by adding accredited certifications.\n   \n2. **Leveraging Preppy’s Unique Sales Model**: Preppy’s innovative, automated enrollment system can provide Google Classroom with a tested approach for engaging students without traditional sales efforts.\n   \n3. **Enhancing Google Classroom’s Ecosystem**: Incorporating Preppy’s career-focused programs can diversify Google Classroom’s portfolio and solidify its position in professional and vocational education.\n\n### Products/Services\nPreppy LLC specializes in 100% online, self-paced programs that prepare individuals for industry certifications in fields ranging from medical billing and welding to ethical hacking. These offerings align with Google Classroom’s aim to democratize education but add an important dimension of job readiness.\n\nGoogle Classroom primarily serves as a platform to manage, create, and distribute educational materials, facilitating interaction between instructors and learners. Its current offerings lack the specialized career and certification programs that Preppy provides.\n\n### Customers\nPreppy caters to individuals aged 25–40 seeking career advancement or changes, focusing on busy adults who prefer affordable, flexible education alternatives. Google Classroom serves a broader audience, including K–12 schools, higher education institutions, and professional training organizations. Despite the variance, both target audiences overlap in the segment of adult learners and professionals seeking upskilling.\n\n### Applicable Cells of The M&A Matrix\n[INSERT M&A MATRIX HERE]\n\nThe transaction fits primarily into **Cell 3** (Complementary/Adjacent Products and Services, Same Customers). Preppy’s vocational certifications complement Google Classroom’s educational platform, serving the shared customer base of students and professionals in need of skill development.\n\nAdditionally, aspects of the acquisition align with **Cell 4** (Complementary/Adjacent Products and Services, Different Customers), as Preppy’s specialized certifications could attract customer segments less familiar with Google Classroom.\n\n### Conclusion\nAcquiring Preppy LLC offers Google Classroom a strategic opportunity to expand into the vocational and professional certification space, enriching its ecosystem and addressing a growing demand for career-aligned education. By integrating Preppy’s offerings and leveraging synergies in their operational models, Google Classroom could further consolidate its leadership in the education sector."
